FernIvy is a command-line tool for measuring energy consumption, with the same interface for both MacOS and Linux. The following configurations are possible:

```txt
syntax:
    fernivy [-h] [-l]
            [-s seconds_to_run | -c command_to_run]
            [-r number_of_runs] [-b seconds_between_runs]
            [-e] [-p] [-t]
            [-o output_file_name | -f output_file_folder]
options:
b     Set the number of second to pause between runs.
c     Run for specified command.
      Put the entire command in quotation marks if it is longer than one word.
e     Print total energy consumption.
f     Set the folder in which to save the output file.
      If it does not exist, it will be created.
h     Print this Help.
l     Run in logging mode.
o     Set output file.
      The path to the file has to exist.
      It cannot start with "temp".
p     Print average power.
r     Set the number of times to run.
s     Run for specified number of seconds.
t     Print total execution time.
```

### Example

The following command will:
* run the experiment 5 times,
* each time measure for 2 seconds,
* take a 1 second break in between,
* print the average
    * power,
    * energy consumed,
    * time elapsed,
* and save the result in "result.csv".

```bash
fernivy -s 1 -r 5 -b 1 -p -e -t -o result
```

You will get the following output on your console:

```txt
|#####| 5/5

Average total energy consumption: 31.290000000000003 J
Average power: 31.24840119389636 W
Average total time elapsed: 1.0013329858 s

Results exported to: result.csv
```

The `result.csv` file will have the following data:

```csv
index,timestamp,total_energy_consumption,average_power,time_elapsed

## Installation

Please follow the installation guide for your operating system, since FernIvy depends on different libraries for each of them.

### MacOS

### Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)

Go to the <a href="https://github.com/fernivy/fernivy/releases/latest" target="blank">latest release on GitHub</a> and download and depackage the `.deb` binary.

FernIvy has two dependencies when running on Linux: `linux-perf` (for measurement) and `python3` (for data processing). They are listed as dependencies in the `.deb` files, so running the following command after the depackaging should fix if they are missing:

```bash
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

You can also choose to install them using the <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/" target="_blank">Installing Python 3 on Linux</a> guide and the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install linux-perf
```
